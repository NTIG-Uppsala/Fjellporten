# Definition of Done

## Before something can be marked as finished (move post-it), the following requirements must be met:

- Everything that works is documented in writing.  
- All debug code is removed.  
- All used material is stored on the drive.  
- Feedback from AI.  
- All code must be approved by [Whatwg Validator](https://whatwg.org/validator/)  
- Everyone present in the group must review the code, make sure they understand it, and ensure that it follows our coding standards.
